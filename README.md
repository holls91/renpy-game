# renpy-game
A renpy game prototype!

## What's this?
Renpy-game is exactly what the name says: a prototype for a fully accessible game in Renpy! Born as a birthday present, you can use it as a start point to make any kind of visual novel!

## What's so special about this prototype?
Oh, nothing really! In this example I've put an hoverable sword that you can use as a start for a fully accessible "hidden-objects" game :) 

Nothing else, really :)
